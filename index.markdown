# Parking in Helsinki

If you have been to Helsinki by car, you will know the hassle of parking. Spots are notoriously hard to find and tickets are 60-80 euros.
That is a lot, especially considering that its only 4 euros an hour in the daytime in the city center, if you're lucky enough to encounter a spot. So if you are planning on driving in Helsinki, this is the page for you. We'll provide some general tips and guide yu trhough, while maybe telling you a good story along the way. By looking into the parking violations data of past years, we allow you to look up specific areas where you may want to park and show you where and when police and parking agents are the most active. We also provide a map of the city, that let's you explore parking violations and shows you where you can find paid parking lots and other stuff.

# Things you should know before driving in Helsinki

Both the police force and a corps of parking agents, often from private companies, are tasked with keeping up with motorists’ bad parking. And they do so quite a lot, a steady total of xx amount of fines have been given out in the years 2014-2017.

The city of Helsinki deals in two types of “fines”, one is a straight forward fine and that is also the most common. They do however also have the option to simply put a notice in the windscreen of your car. More friendly than a fine, this is a reminder that you haven’t parked all that well, but you won’t get a fine! As you can see from the below plots, this notice is not widely used. But if you do get one, it will most likely be from the parking agents, the police do not bother to use these (beside 1 given out in 2014) and only deal with actuals tickets.

But if you do want to file a complaint, you shouldn’t expect much to come from it as the vast majority of disputes are settled in favour of the parking enforcement companies.  However, if you are a tourist bringing your own car, you might be able to park in a slightly riskier manner, as the city has been mostly unable to actually get a hold of the money, when they have fined a foreign vehicle for a parking violation. A whopping 80 percent of fines given to foreign vehicles between 2012-2017 thus remains unpaid, costing the city an estimated 4,5 million Euros in lost income. 

# Still planning on taking the car?

If you remain undeterred, you've come to the right place. Because planning is gonna be important and it is worth contemplating, where you should park your car – or perhaps rather, where you really shouldn’t park your car!


# Density of the data - city center can be an expensive place to park!

Top 10 locations for the parking ticket in Helsinki.
 


Mäntymäenkenttä parkin area located in Töölö is the the place to go in case you want to find a yellow piece of paper from your car window. The Mäntymäki parking area functions as a parking area connected to nearby public buildings such as the Olympiastadion, the Töölö sports hall and the Opera. Actually Mäntymäenkenttä was the most likely place in Helsinki for the parking ticket between 2014-2017 as we can see from the attached figure. By the far most frequent reason for a ticket in the parking area, was due to parking in places reserved for buses (3447). In addition, parking without parking ID/parking device/parking ticket (1878) and unauthorized parking in a private area (1680) were also common reasons for tickets.

The mäntymäenkenttä parking area became chargeable in September 2013. After that, the parking fee at Mäntymäenkenttä was 2 e/hour between 9-21 on weekdays and otherwise free of charge. This change most likely explains why there were significantly fewer parking tickets in 2015 compared to 2014. At 2014, those that have been parking there earlier, were coming and thinking that the parking would be still free and got unpleasant suprise, but learned from that and did not make the same mistake again in the following year.

Several large event centers are located nerby such as Olympiastadion, Opera House and Töölö sports hall. These three alone can hold a total of about 45 thousand people. Thus, several sporting events and concerts are organized in the nearby area every year, and therefore Mäntymäenkenttä is in heavy use, especially during the weekends when the Olympiastadion is in use. Considering that most of the earlier mentioned events are held during weekends, it's inevitable to start to question whether the events are the main reason for the large amount of tickets and could there also be something else behind the phenomenon.

![Olympiastadion next to Mäntymäenkenttä](/Olympiastadion_and_mäntymäenkenttä.png)

Most of the events organized in the area are scheduled for the summer months, so the parking fines could be expected to be concentrated in these months. However, we can see from the following graph that this is not really the case. In addition, a major renovation started at the Olympiastadion at the end of 2015, which closed it for almost five years. However, this did not reduce the number of parking fines  on 2016 and 2017, but actually the opposite. Of course, the statictics are affected by many different things, such as the activity of the inspectors but clearly most of the tickets do not fall on the people who are attending the events. It's possible that most of the fines fall on commuters and the residents of the surronding areas. The summer months are common summer vacation months and the fine amounts are naturallly smaller then. In addition, we notice from the graph that the amount of parking tickets did not restore after Covid, even though events were organized in 2022 in the area as before Covid. Therefore, it is most likely that the change is due to the fact that remote work became more common during Covid, and as a result the amount commuters to the center of Helsinki decreased dramatically.

However, if the review the yearly and monthly distribution of the two most common reasons for parking ticket (Parking tickets due to parking in places reserved for buses and parking without parking ID/parking device/parking ticket) we notice something interesting. We are able to see from the following graphs that the yearly and monthly pattern in the parking ticket data is mostly due to tickets due to parking in places reserved for buses. When we remember that you can also get a ticket for that on weekend, even though parking is free during the then, we realize that it is possible that in case there are big events nearby, people leave their cars to the places for buses intentionally or accidentally. This would at least explain why there is so huge differences between amount of tickets between the months.

On the other hand, there are also many people living in the area where private parking space prices easily rise to more than 200 euros per month. Therefore, a nearby parking lot with free parking overnight, is an attractive option. The writer is able to testify that sometimes it is possible to forgot your car to the parking area, which offers a perfect opportunity for the inspector during the first hours of morning... It would be interesting to study this in more detail and see if the most of the fines are given at 9am. However, the data does not reveal the exact time when the fine was issued and it remains a mystery how large a share the residents of the surrounding areas have for the total amount of fines.


# Does the placement of the traffic signs cause the tickets?

When looking at the map describing the distribution of parking fines in Helsinki, most of the top 10 locations have reached the statistics thanks to the parking area located at the spot. However, two particular address catches the eye: Mikonkatu 15 and Salomonkatu 19. There are no large parking area connected with these addresses. Mikonkatu 15 is located next to central railwaystation and the large number of tickets is probably explained by that. However, Salomonkatu 19 catches the eye. There is no parking area located there and it seems strange how big amount of tickets are coming from such as small street. After research, it turns out that parking at Salomonkatu 19 is completely prohibited. The most common reason for parking ticket is thus not obeying the no-parking zone traffic sign (4 946 between 2014 and 2022).The question is whether it is really the case that so many people park on the street on purpose or whether some other factor affects the matter.

The Kamppi shopping center and several different services are located nearby Salomonkatu 19 and thus the street may be a attractive place to leave your car to. It's a bit to the side of the shopping center, and it's quick to leave car there. However, it's really unlikely that so many people would leave their car on purpose knowing that they might get a ticket. There must be something else here...

According to Kossila (2019) no parking zone traffic sign is particularly poorly known in Finland(HS, 2019).Or maybe there is some factor causing that people don't simply know about the of the no parking-zone. That is why the location of the sign also raises questions. The sign is located immediately after the roundabout, where the drivers focus is in multiple different things at the same time. When turning right, the driver must look out of the pedestrians and cyclist, and it could be hard to notice the parking sign at the same time. Could the placement of sign cause that drivers don't notice it and therefore get an unpleasant surprise? Maybe the location of the sign could be changed to avoid the unnecessary parking fines. However, it might be too productive for the city and thus there isn't change in sight. Or maybe the city doesn't even know about the situation.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, parking in Helsinki can be challenging and expensive. The data analysis and visualizations reveal that parking violations are prevalent in the city, with a steady total of fines given out during each year. Two types of penalties are issued: fines and notices. While fines are the most common form, the city also utilizes notices as reminders for inadequate parking. However, the use of notices is limited, with parking agents primarily responsible for them, while the police focus on issuing actual tickets when necessary for them.

To assist drivers in navigating parking in Helsinki, the article provides visual representations of the distribution of parking tickets and notices across different postal codes. Additionally, it highlights the top locations where parking tickets are issued, such as the Mäntymäenkenttä parking area in Töölö. This particular area is frequently associated with parking violations, mainly due to parking in places reserved for buses, parking without a valid ticket or ID, and unauthorized parking in private areas. 

Furthermore, the article raises questions about the effectiveness of traffic sign placement and its influence on parking violations. The example of Salomonkatu 19 demonstrates that despite a clear no-parking zone, a significant number of tickets are issued in that area. The placement of the no-parking sign immediately after a roundabout raises concerns about driver awareness and potential surprises. It suggests that drivers may not notice the sign due to distractions and the need to focus on other aspects of driving, leading to unintentional violations.
